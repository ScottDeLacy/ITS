This is a dump of a couple partial directories to make the site. I have not vetted it or tested it etc.
I know I had a clean installer somewhere, but its not located. This has me concerned that its an older version I'm publishing. Sorry.

Read any enclosed readme's and point the settings at your database or the site wont work.


test.php should I think display just a static setup of what it would look like with default settings.

template.php is soemthing you can customise, such as logo, headings etc to suit your use case.
saving your version to 'index.php' is probably the way to go, the rest of the php files are either includes or were for testing and may be useful or not.
